# vimbook-code

This repository contains the essential code from the Springer book Visualization and Impuation of Missing Values
by Matthias Templ, University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW).

This code is illustrated and explained in the book. Here this code is shown to save copying and pasting. The code is therefore of limited use without the explanations in the book, as the comments on this code can only be found in the book. 

There is two exceptions:

- code for impGAM and deepImp are only be found in the book. These functions are planned to be released in 2023, but still are not part of package VIM.

Note also that there is not much code on the application of the methods themselves, since the aim of the book is to explain the methods, while the application in R is often trivial (e.g. `VIM::irmi(x)`, with `x` a data frame with missing values).
